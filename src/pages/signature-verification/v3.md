## Signature verification instructions for Ghaf 24.09.3 - 25.11.1

1. Download the target artifact you want from the release page (here represented
   as `archive.tar`)
2. Navigate to where the tar file is.
3. Extract the archive into a folder and enter it:

```sh
tar -xf archive.tar
cd archive
```

4. Locate the image file and its signature. Note that for some targets they are
   located in `sd-image` directory.

5. Run the verification script with the path of the image and signature:

```sh
nix run github:tiiuae/ci-yubi/bdb2dbf#verify -- \
    --cert INT-Ghaf-Devenv-Image \
    --path disk1.raw.zst \
    --sigfile disk1.raw.zst.sig
```

6. You should see the following message upon successful signature verification:

```
Signature verification result: {'message': 'Signature Verification Result', 'is_valid': True}
```

7. The same instructions apply for the provenance file as well, located in the
   `scs` directory. Note that the cert name is different.

```sh
nix run github:tiiuae/ci-yubi/bdb2dbf#verify -- \
    --cert INT-Ghaf-Devenv-Provenance \
    --path scs/provenance.json \
    --sigfile scs/provenance.json.sig
```

```
Signature verification result: {'message': 'Signature Verification Result', 'is_valid': True}
```
