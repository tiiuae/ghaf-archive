## Signature verification instructions for Ghaf 25.12.1 ->

1. Download the target artifact you want from the release page (here represented
   as `archive.tar`)
2. Download the binary signing key (`GhafInfraSignECP256.pub`)
3. Navigate to where the tar file is.
4. Extract the archive into a folder and enter it:

```sh
tar -xf archive.tar
cd archive
```

5. Locate the image file and its signature. Note that for some targets they are
   located in `sd-image/` directory.

6. Run the following `openssl` command with the correct paths of the public key,
   signature and image:

```sh
openssl dgst -verify \
    GhafInfraSignECP256.pub \
    -signature disk1.raw.zst.sig \
    disk1.raw.zst
```

7. You should see the following message upon successful signature verification:

```
Verified OK
```

8. The provenance file is verified with a different `openssl` command. Note that
   the public key used is also different.

```sh
openssl pkeyutl -verify \
    -inkey GhafInfraSignProv.pub -pubin \
    -sigfile provenance.json.sig \
    -in provenance.json -rawin
```

```
Signature Verified Successfully
```
